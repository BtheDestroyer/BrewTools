BrewTools is an open source Homebrew library for C/C++. It's being developed to make the development process easier, faster, and more accessible for ourselves and other developers. Currently 3DS and Wii U support are planned, but other platforms may be given support in the future.

If you have any suggestions or requests for future additions, please create an issue!

## "Do I need to install anything before this?"

Make sure devkitPro and devkitARM are installed. Other than that, installing BrewTools should automatically install other dependencies.

## "Why is your style so weird?" "Why do you make your lines so short?" "Why no tabs?!"

We're following the [ANSI C Standard](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C). This means, among other things, that we use 2 spaces instead of tabs which makes sure our code looks the same by having the same width on everyone's computer regardless of OS, text editor, or settings. The 80 character count per line also ensures this and makes sure everyone can use their own setup such as having a vertical monitor for coding.
