# About

BrewTools is an open source library for C++ game development. It's being developed to make the development process easier, faster, and more accessible for ourselves and other developers. Currently, Windows™ is supported through OpenGL, but Linux is planned as well. Nintendo 3DS™ and Wii U™ support are planned through homebrew libraries. Other platforms like the Nintendo Switch™ may be given support in the future.

Creating and distributing content made with BrewTools is completely alright so long as the following lines is listed *somewhere* (such as the credits) in the released content:

# FAQ

## "Do I need to install anything before this?"

For Nintendo 3DS™ and Wii U™ development, make sure devkitPro and devkitARM are installed. Other than that, installing BrewTools should automatically install other dependencies.

## "Why is your style so weird?" "Why do you make your lines so short?" "Why no tabs?!"

We're following the [ANSI C Standard](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C). This means, among other things, that we use 2 spaces instead of tabs which makes sure our code looks the same by having the same width on everyone's computer regardless of OS, text editor, or settings. The 80 character count per line also ensures this and makes sure everyone can use their own setup such as having a vertical monitor for coding.

## "You should add _____" "_____ is broken for me. Why?"

Create an [issue](https://github.com/bthedestroyer/BrewTools/issues) so we can get your feedback. We're happy to add any ideas that would make the library better!
